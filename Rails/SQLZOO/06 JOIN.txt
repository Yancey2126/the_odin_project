1.

The first example shows the goal scored by 'Bender'.

Show matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. teamid = 'GER'

SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'

2.

From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's goal was scored in game 1012. Notice that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table.

Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for game 1012


SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game 
 WHERE id = 1012

3.

You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN. You will get all the game details and all the goal details if you use

SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)


SELECT player,teamid, mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
where teamid='GER'

4.

Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.

Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'

SELECT team1, team2, player
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
where player like 'Mario%'

5.

The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id

Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

SELECT player, teamid, coach,gtime
  FROM goal join eteam on teamid=id
 WHERE gtime<=10

6.

To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)

Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id

List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.



SELECT mdate, teamname
  FROM game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)
 WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos'



7.

List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

select player
from game join goal on matchid=id
where stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
